# rustlings_exercises
Following along with rust-lang/rustlings

Note to self: Open this directory in a terminal and run `rustlings`.
I can do this using the integrated terminal of RustRover after opening the folder as a project in it.
I can even click the exercise links to open them in RustRover specifically, rather than my system's default source code editor.
