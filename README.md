# Rustlings Exercises
Following along with [rust-lang/rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)

Note to self: Open this directory in a terminal and run `rustlings`.
I can do this using the integrated terminal of RustRover, after opening the folder as a project.
This even allows me to click the lines the errors occur at to open them in RustRover specifically, rather than my system's default source code editor.
